# ramdisk
Creates a ramdisk

Creating an in-memory file system.  

The 'easy-way' is to make use of the unix filesystem tmpfs.  (could also use ramfs, but this gives unlimited access to memory)

Run locally (on a unix-like machine).

```bash
cd easy_way && ./local_validate.sh
```

Run in a docker instance (on a unix-like machine).
```bash
cd easy_way && ./docker_validate.sh
```
